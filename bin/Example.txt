This virtual glimpse into the cosmoss past is the result of CoDaIII, the third iteration of the Cosmic/
Dawn Project which traces the history of the universe, beginning with the cosmic dark ages about/
10 million years after the Big Bang. At that point, hot gas produced at the very beginning of time,/
about 13.8 billion years ago, had cooled to a featureless cloud devoid of light, says astronomer Paul/
Shapiro of the University of Texas at Austin.document with meaning./#/

Head will point to the first element of the list, and tail will point to the last element in the list./ Image result for tail in circular doubly linked list 
In the simple linked list, all the nodes will point to their next element and tail will point to null./
The circular linked list is the collection of nodes in which tail node also point back to head node./#/
Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance,/
implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer/
programs.These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development/
is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual/
writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices./
Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand an/
existing program and re-implement its function/#/#
